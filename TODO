Hardware:
    1. Clean up emulator:
        PHASE 1: PREPARATION & DIRECTORY SETUP:
            Create new folder structure:
                ✔ src/core/ (CPU, Bus, Logic) @done(25-12-24 15:25)
                ✔ src/devices/ (Video, Storage, Terminal) @done(25-12-24 15:25)
                ✔ src/frontend/ (Raylib, GUI, Input mapping) @done(25-12-24 15:25)
                ✔ include/ (Public headers) @done(25-12-24 15:25)
                ✔ external/ (Third-party libraries) @done(25-12-24 15:25)
            ✔ Setup a Build System (Makefile or CMakeLists.txt) to handle subdirectories. @done(25-12-24 15:25)
            ✔ Initialize Git and create a .gitignore to exclude build artifacts. @done(25-12-27 03:22)
        PHASE 2: CORE ENGINE REFACTORING:
            ✔ Implement the TaleaMachine struct in talea.h to hold all global state. @done(25-12-24 15:25)
            ✔ Create the System Bus (src/core/bus.c) to route memory-mapped I/O. @done(25-12-24 15:25)
            ✔ Move CPU instruction logic and the RunCycles loop to src/core/cpu.c. @done(25-12-24 15:25)
            ✔ Ensure CPU only interacts with memory through the Bus interface. @done(25-12-24 15:25)
            ✔ Modularize the Storage Device (src/devices/storage.c). @done(25-12-24 15:25)
            ✔ Remove direct Raylib/UI calls from the storage backend. @done(25-12-27 03:22)
        PHASE 3: FRONTEND & UI SEPARATION:
            ☐ cooler UI
            ✔ Move all Raylib initialization and shader code to src/frontend/. @done(25-12-24 15:26)
            ✔ Move UpdateDrawFrame logic to a dedicated renderer module. @done(25-12-24 15:26)
            ✔ Refactor the GUI to modify the machine state via API functions. @done(25-12-25 19:32)
            ✔ Create a dedicated input handler to map Raylib keys to internal scancodes. @done(25-12-24 15:26)
            ☐ Isolate Audio (OPLL and PCM stream) into src/devices/audio.c.
    ☐ 2. Test for UB and memory leaks
    ☐ 3. Document everyting:
        ☐ Emulator code
        ☐ Talea System Manual
    ☐ 4. Create a working network stack
    ☐ finish video device
    5. Polish everithing:
        ☐ Make memory size able to be configurable and not hardcoded
        ☐ Make Rom non writable at 16MB - 32K in the address space
        ☐ Make sure all memory writes pass through WriteMain or WriteData
        ☐ Implement a tiered logging system (INFO, WARN, ERROR).
        ✘ Implement loading a sesqui. @cancelled(25-12-31 21:36)
        ☐ Standardize error handling (replace exit(1) with safe defaults).
        ☐ Write a comprehensive README.md with build instructions.
        ✔ Add a standard Open Source License file (e.g., MIT or GPL). @done(25-12-27 03:22)
        ☐ Fix hardcoded paths to allow the app to run from any directory.
        ☐ Include a "Hello World" assembly sample for new users.
    ☐ 6. Make a website
    ☐ 7. Package a distribution and use a well structured git

Software:
    Ttty library:
        ☐ multiplexer
        ☐ printf
        ☐ ANSI escapes
        ☐ colors?

    8. Make a simple SDK for games and little apps:
        ☐ Minimal OS
        ☐ Text editor (visual)
        ☐ Assembler
        ☐ C cross compiler and simple library (no c stdilb)
        ☐ Self hosted compiler (can be any language)
        ☐ Interpreter
        Hardware libraries and for games:
            ☐ Graphics
            ☐ UI
            ☐ Sound
            ☐ Text
            ☐ Input
            ☐ Network
        ☐ Image editor
        ☐ Music and sound editor
        ☐ Binary editor
        ☐ Utilities
        ☐ BBS client
        ☐ Message client

9. Resources, community and network:
    ☐ Subreddit
    ☐ Discord
    ☐ Software distribution
    ☐ In-universe BBS server (decentralized?)

    
Misc:
     Language coverage:
        ☐ Alantar 'Lanat
        ☐ English
        ☐ Spanish
            
    ☐ 10. Promotion and maintenance
        

Bugs:
    ☐ when shutting down with the UI button, the socket cannot reconnect
    ☐ when loading a firmware and closing the emulator, the string on the config file of windows does not escape backlashes properly
    ☐ In init window, we have to hack the hidpi, seems it broke a little bit ago in raylib?
